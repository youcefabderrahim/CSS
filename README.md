## 🎨 CSS Practice Challenges  
*A complete roadmap of practical CSS challenges designed to take you from layout fluency to animation mastery. Build, style, and polish — one challenge at a time. Push every completed challenge to your GitHub repository as proof of progress.*  

---

### 🌱 **STAGE 1 – Core Styling Warm-up**  
**Goal:** Get comfortable manipulating text, color, and spacing.  

💡 *Focus: font, color, margin, padding, box model.*  

- Create a styled **profile card** with name, avatar, and short bio.  
- Design a **quote card** using Google Fonts and subtle shadows.  
- Recreate a **button set** (primary, secondary, danger) using `:hover` and `:active`.  
- Style a **list of items** (shopping list, to-do list) with spacing and custom bullets.  
- Make a **simple pricing tag** (e.g., “$9/month”) with border, padding, and text alignment.  

🧭 *Tip:* Focus on understanding spacing — the difference between margin and padding defines your precision later.  

---

### 🧩 **STAGE 2 – Flexbox Fundamentals**  
**Goal:** Master alignment, spacing, and responsiveness with Flexbox.  

💡 *Focus: `display: flex`, alignment, gap, wrapping.*  

- Build a **navigation bar** with evenly spaced links and logo.  
- Create a **3-column layout** (like a simple blog or product grid).  
- Center an element both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox.  
- Make a **responsive card container** that wraps and reflows on small screens.  
- Rebuild a **login form** centered using Flexbox.  

🧭 *Tip:* Experiment with `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-basis` until they feel natural.  

---

### 🧱 **STAGE 3 – Grid Layout Mastery**  
**Goal:** Gain control over 2D layouts and complex compositions.  

💡 *Focus: `display: grid`, areas, fractions, minmax, gap.*  

- Create a **dashboard layout** (header, sidebar, main content, footer).  
- Design a **photo gallery** that auto-fills columns with `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...))`.  
- Rebuild a **news website layout** using CSS Grid areas.  
- Create a **CSS-only calendar grid**.  
- Combine **Grid + Flexbox** to make a responsive landing page section.  

🧭 *Tip:* Think in *areas* and *tracks*, not pixels.  

---

### 🌈 **STAGE 4 – Positioning & Layering**  
**Goal:** Understand how elements stack, overlap, and move.  

💡 *Focus: `position`, `z-index`, relative vs absolute, fixed, sticky.*  

- Create a **sticky navbar** that stays on top during scroll.  
- Build a **card with a badge** positioned in the corner.  
- Make a **tooltip** appear above a hovered button.  
- Design a **modal popup** with a dark overlay.  
- Recreate a **floating action button (FAB)** in the bottom-right corner.  

🧭 *Tip:* Play with stacking contexts and experiment with transparency.  

---

### ⚙️ **STAGE 5 – Transitions & Animations**  
**Goal:** Bring motion and life to your designs.  

💡 *Focus: `transition`, `transform`, `@keyframes`.*  

- Animate a **button hover** (grow/shrink, color fade).  
- Create a **loading spinner** using only CSS.  
- Animate a **sliding menu** (open/close effect).  
- Build a **bouncing ball** animation loop.  
- Create a **typewriter effect** for text.  

🧭 *Tip:* Chain transitions — color + transform together feel much smoother than one alone.  

---

### 🧭 **STAGE 6 – Responsive Design Challenges**  
**Goal:** Make your layouts adapt to different screen sizes.  

💡 *Focus: `@media`, fluid units, flexible grids.*  

- Turn a **desktop navbar** into a **mobile hamburger menu** (CSS-only).  
- Build a **responsive pricing table**.  
- Create a **hero section** that scales typography fluidly.  
- Make a **two-column layout** that becomes one on mobile.  
- Design a **responsive image grid** with different aspect ratios.  

🧭 *Tip:* Use `em`, `rem`, `vw`, and `vh` — avoid hard pixels when possible.  

---

### 🎨 **STAGE 7 – Advanced Styling & Effects**  
**Goal:** Explore creative CSS and push visual boundaries.  

💡 *Focus: gradients, filters, clip-path, pseudo-elements, CSS art.*  

- Create a **gradient background animation**.  
- Design **neumorphic** or **glassmorphic** cards.  
- Build a **CSS-only progress bar**.  
- Create a **hover reveal effect** using `clip-path`.  
- Make a **CSS illustration or logo** using only `::before` and `::after`.  

🧭 *Tip:* Play. This is where creativity grows — it’s okay if things look weird.  

---

### 🧰 **STAGE 8 – Integration Projects (CSS + JS)**  
**Goal:** Combine your CSS knowledge with your JavaScript DOM logic.  

💡 *Focus: dynamic classes, JS-triggered animations.*  

- Animated **dark/light theme toggle**.  
- Expandable **accordion sections** with smooth transitions.  
- **Modal windows** and **slide-in sidebars** controlled via JS.  
- **Scroll reveal effects** using JS + CSS animations.  
- Interactive **CSS-based games UI** (start screen, score board, etc.).  

🧭 *Tip:* These will prepare you for your next roadmap steps — DOM projects and your Games Website.  

---

### 🚀 **How to Practice**
- Work through each stage in order.  
- Commit after each challenge — include a short note on what you learned.  
- Revisit earlier challenges with new tricks (Flex → Grid, static → animated).  
- Keep screenshots or live previews — your GitHub becomes your *visual resume*.

### 💬 Final Note
CSS mastery isn’t about memorizing properties — it’s about **intuition through repetition**.  
The more layouts and animations you *build by hand*, the faster your instincts will become.  

**Keep your code clean, readable, and modular. Style with purpose, not decoration.**
